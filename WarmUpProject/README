If you just want to see the plots, run plotResults.py
If you want to see p-value and Spearman Rank, run dataAnalysis.py

If you just gathered data from typeform, you can process the data using the following steps.
1. run processRawResult.py, it will process the raw result ("responses.csv"),
    and write to a file named "ungraded_good_result.csv"
2. Then manually grade the file, call it "manually_graded.csv":
    add 6 more columns for the 6 questions. grade them with [0, 1]
3. Then load the "manually_graded.csv". into autoGradeResults.py,
    this will generate columns of scores of the questions, named "auto_graded.csv"
4. you can run data analysis on "auto_graded.csv" using dataAnalysis.py
5. you can plot the data of "auto_graded.csv" with plotResult.py
