This project is trying to unravel the relationship between a programmer's english proficiency and his coding
proficiency. We created a survey and handed it out to people, then we gather the results and preformed several data
analysis on it. Here are the methods:

We first need to gather data, data for each participants include his english proficiency and his coding proficiency
We assess by three aspects:
Self - objective assess
Self - subjective assess
Subjective assess:

for english, the self - objective assesses are:
1. are you a native english speaker
2. How many hours per day do you spend speaking English?

for english, the self - subjective assesses are:
1. can you watch movies without subtitles?
2. How often do you use variable names transcribed from your language while coding?
3. How would you rate your English proficiency?

for english, the objective assess are:
1. None


for coding proficiency, the self - objective assess are:
1. How would you rate your coding proficiency?

for coding, the self - subjective assesses are:
1. How many years have you worked coding (not including higher education)

for coding, the objective assess are:
1. Which of the following is a Boolean?
2. Which website do you use for coding help?
3. 6 coding questions

then for each of the three category:
we normalize each question's score to 0 - 1, based on the full score of the question, and added up by unweighted average
Then we normalize the total score for this category to 0 - 1, based on all participants
(the two normalization methods are different because for little question, there is always someone who's right, besides,
it's usually binary, right or wrong, so if a question is T/F and no one gets it right, then it wouldn't make sense to
normalize)
Finally, we added up the three category by unweighted average.
