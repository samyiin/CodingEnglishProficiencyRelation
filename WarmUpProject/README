Here is how to use the scripts
1. load the raw result into processRawResult.py, it will write to a file named ungraded_good_result.csv
2. Then manually grade the file, call it graded.csv
3. Then load the graded.csv. into autoGradeResults.py, this will generate columns of scores of the questions
4. you can run data analysis using dataAnalysis.py
5. you can plot the data with plotResult.py
All you need to do is to remember to change the IO file names
